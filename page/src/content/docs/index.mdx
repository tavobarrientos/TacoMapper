var personDto = ObjectMapper.Map<Person, PersonDto>(person);

// Fluent API with custom mapping
var mapper = ObjectMapper.Create<Person, PersonDto>()
    .Map(dest => dest.Id, src => src.Id)
    .Map(dest => dest.Age, src => src.DateOfBirth, dob => DateTime.Now.Year - dob.Year)
    .Combine(dest => dest.FullName, src => $"{src.FirstName} {src.LastName}");

var result = mapper.MapFrom(person);
```
